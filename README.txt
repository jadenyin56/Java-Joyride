Responsibilites
Jaden: Solo Project :(

--------------------------------Jetpack Joyride Game------------------------------
Known Bugs:
- Made the hitbox on the character smaller than the actual drawing
- COULD CRASH after dying (has not happened in a while tho)
- Gif coins doesn't fully register properly and flickers in certain area


Missing Functions:
- 1) KEEPING TRACK OF HIGHSCORES USING NAMES
- 2) Animations for the lasers (laser warnings)
- 3) Sound Effects
- 4) Shop but never was gonna do that really
- 5) Pause screen, found it really hard to have a grace period before unpausing

Main thing was the highscore tracking

Added Functions:
- Missile Tracking
- Randomized Background
- Fuel Bar
- Making the lasers activate ONLY when screen is cleared

----OVERALL----
PLEASE ONLY RUN the DRIVER FILE 
I mean you could run the Jetpack Joyride one too but it was a testing file
